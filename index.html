The website is dual-purpose.
The primary consideration is to display and offer eBooks to an audience that would be
interested in buying them to enjoy.
The second important aspect of the website is to engage interested parties to read my blog and
participate in comment, critique and discussion on myriad subjects both historical and current.
These subjects would at times be generated by me and of course I would look forward to
subjects of interest to my readers.
After all, life is a two-way affair.
I have written three sets of trilogies. These are explained in the presentation section of the
genres.
I write on the back of several genres. These include:
Fictional Crime mystery. The content of my stories are a mixture of fact and fiction to render
them more believable and interesting from the point of view of being able to relate to a scene
that is being described or a place where an incident takes place.
It needs to be said from the outset that the crime stories I write are to some extent dark and
graphic in their content.
Also, they are meticulously researched from the point of view of Police procedure, Forensic
examination and theory.
Also, I believe in stories with players where powerful characters are developed to drive the
narrative.
Finally, I have written two trilogies in this genre.
These can be viewed in the Books section and all are available as eBooks from Amazon.
Science Fiction/Fantasy. Second to the above genre, I love writing Science fiction or Science
Fantasy. In a broader context I suppose it is fantasy. I have departed from the Star Wars, Star
Trek formats and created my own Universe of Fantasy. Within this universe, I created new alien
races with all their inherent domestic conflicts, fears and ambitions. I have created terrifying
weapons systems, powerful space travelling vehicles and inter-galactic wars and conflicts to
boggle the mind.
Along the way, I have introduced two alien languages that are used in dialogue between
antagonists and protagonists.
I believe this lends a sense of belonging and individuality to the stories.
I have written one trilogy in the genre.
Non-fiction. Branching out and away from fiction, I have written a short book that deals with
spirituality and to some extent with religion. This is a personal point of view that is the product of
intense research and investigation. I am certain many would disagree with its content but then I
also believe every individual is entitled to his or her point of view.
I trust you have enjoyed this short introduction to my Homepage. Please open the pages that
follow and peruse the titles of the eBooks that are available from Amazon.
Kind regards,
Andrew Fox.

SYNOPSIS
From the ancient, blood-soaked sands of Egypt, emerges the greatest treasure ever
discovered.
Its origins are veiled within the mists of time. The power it possesses is coveted by all those
who know of its existence.
An evil Egyptian Queen, the power behind the throne of Seti Third the Usurper
persuades the Pharaoh to massacre the entire Priesthood when possession of it is denied her.
Throughout the ages, it has been unsuccessfully sought by Kings, conquers and every
manner of a treasure hunter.
It is said that Alexander the Macedonian conquered Egypt to possess it!

plan his death.
Jones, with few friends and a shrinking bank balance, finds himself back in Egypt! Lured
there by the mention of a great treasure inside a previously undiscovered tomb.

golden tablets meticulously inscribed with hieroglyphs placed there by an ancient priest.
Determined to solve the mystery of this most peculiar phenomenon, Jones sets about
deciphering the manuscripts. The experience changes his life and catapults him down a path of
certain self-destruction. Howard Jones is brutally murdered.
Peter Caine, a controversial Detective Chief Inspector, investigates the murder. Thrown
into a bloody maelstrom of violence and murderous retribution, the bodies start to pile up along
the trail of Caine’s enquiry. Who will be next? Will Caine also fall victim to the murderer?
In one of the most complex cases of his life, Caine is pitted against a gang of
conspirators who have an axe to grind with Howard Jones. Reaching into the past, Caine
attempts to unravel the mystery that claimed Jones’ life.
Caine is strongly supported by Doctor Robert Coleman Chief Forensics Investigator
from the Home Office Department of Pathology.
Facts emerge indicating that many of those suspected of Jones’ murder have previous,
historic connections with each other. A new housing development in Gloucester unwittingly
unearths several bodies connected to the ongoing enquiry putting several suspects clearly in
the frame!
As the pressure on him mounts, Caine reverts to questionable tactics, assaults a suspect
and is suspended.

about investigating without the approval or support of the Metropolitan Police Service.
